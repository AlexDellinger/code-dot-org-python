Skins for the 'artist' challenge type.

To make your own just create a directory and replace every asset with
your new ones, or just `cp -r default` and replace individual resources
you want to change.

Python `tkinter` only supports GIF image format for colored images. While
Python PIL and Pillow support about every known image format we do not
add them to preserve the just-Python dependency.
